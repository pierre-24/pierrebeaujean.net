# Hi! *I'm Pierre*

I have a Ph.D. in quantum chemistry (obtained in October 2021 in the [university of Namur](https://www.unamur.be/)).
Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher on the [ECOBAT (EOS) project](https://eos-ecobat.eu/), to study new batteries from a quantum chemistry point of view.
I also recently (June 2020) obtained a [bachelor in Computer Science](https://directory.unamur.be/teaching/programmes/870B?_LOCALE_=en).

During my free time, I like to [shoot photos](https://pics.pierrebeaujean.net) 📷, [write things](https://blog.pierrebeaujean.net/) ✍️, read 📖, code 🖥️, bike 🚴‍♂️, climb 🧗‍♂️, or enjoy a beer 🍺 with my friends!
