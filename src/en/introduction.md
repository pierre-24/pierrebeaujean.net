# Hi! *I'm Pierre Beaujean*

I have a Ph.D. in quantum chemistry (concerning **nonlinear optics** and obtained in October 2021 in the [university of Namur](https://www.unamur.be/)).
I also recently (2020) obtained a [bachelor in Computer Science](https://directory.unamur.be/teaching/programmes/870B?_LOCALE_=en).
Currently, I'm an ambassador for the [Belgian EuroCC NCC](https://www.enccb.be/) for training and user awareness.

During my free times, I like to [shoot photos](https://pics.pierrebeaujean.net) 📷, read 📖, code 🖥️, bike 🚴‍♂️, climb 🧗‍♂️, or enjoy a beer 🍺 with my friends!
