I am a member of the [Belgian National Competence Center](https://www.enccb.be/) (NCC) in high-performance computing, developed by a European Union's initiative named [EuroCC](https://www.eurocc-access.eu/). 
It aims at fostering the activities in terms of high-performance computing (HPC), high-performance data analysis (HPDA) and artificial intelligence (AI) in Belgium. 
In particular, my goals are to **develop (future) user's skills** and to **raise general awareness** about the interest of such tools.

Previously, I was a teaching assistant in the laboratory of [Prof Beno√Æt Champagne](https://www.unamur.be/en/sci/chemistry/lct), where I pursued and graduated from a **Ph.D. thesis in the field of quantum chemistry**.
It focused on the evaluation of the nonlinear optical (NLO) response of molecules or systems in gas or condensed phase, through computations at the Hartree-Fock, DFT or Coupled Cluster levels, for the evaluation of different contributions. 
The theoretical work was carried out in close collaboration with experimental characterizations, through our collaborators or the literature.
