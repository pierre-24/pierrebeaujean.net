I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [ECOBAT](https://eos-ecobat.eu/) (part of the [EOS](https://www.fwo.be/en/fellowships-funding/research-projects/eos-research-project/) program) at the [University of Namur](https://unamur.be).
My goal is to study new batteries from a quantum chemistry level, more specifically focusing on the interface between the anode and the electrolyte, the [solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium%E2%80%93silicon_battery#Solid_electrolyte_interphase_layer).

Previously, I was a member of the [Belgian National Competence Center](https://www.enccb.be/) (NCC) in high-performance computing, focusing on **developing (future) user's skills** and **raising general awareness** about the interest of such tools.

During my PhD, I was a teaching assistant in the laboratory of [Prof Beno√Æt Champagne](https://www.unamur.be/en/sci/chemistry/lct).
It had focused on the evaluation of the **nonlinear optical (NLO) response** of molecules or systems in gas or condensed phase, through computations at different level of approximations. 
This work has been carried out in close collaboration with experimental characterizations, through our collaborators or the literature.
