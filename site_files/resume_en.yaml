  text: "# Hi! *I'm Pierre Beaujean*

  I'm a Ph.D. student (in the field of quantum chemistry, more specifically **nonlinear optics**) and teaching assistant in [the laboratory of Professor Beno√Æt Champagne](https://www.unamur.be/en/sci/chemistry/lct), in the [University of Namur](https://www.unamur.be/) (in Belgium) where I also started a [bachelor in Computer Science](https://directory.unamur.be/teaching/programmes/870B?_LOCALE_=en).
  During my free times, when I'm not reading, swimming, biking, or enjoying a beer with my friends, I'm involved in [Zeste de Savoir](https://zestedesavoir.com/), a French website for knowledges sharing. "

research_topics: "*Dynamical nonlinear optical systems: a multiscale theoretical chemistry investigation*.


  My Ph.D. thesis focuses on the evaluation of the nonlinear optical response of molecules or systems in gas or condensed phase.
  It includes computations at the Hartree-Fock, DFT or Coupled Cluster levels for the evaluation of the different contributions.
  The theoretical works is carried out in close collaboration with experimental characterizations, through our collaborators or the literature."
